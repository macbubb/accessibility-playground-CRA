# Accessibility Playground

Welcome to the Accessibility Playground! This repository is designed as a sandbox to highlight and explore common accessibility issues found in web applications. The site is intentionally filled with accessibility problems for educational purposes. Your challenge is to identify, document, and fix these issues.

## Installation and Local Development
